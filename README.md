# Hello!
In order to launch my precious game, you have to have a computer. If you are rich enough to allow yourself such luxury life, you may also want to have installed Python. Google it, if you don't know how.

Now we're talking, boy. So for the next step, once you've downloaded all my files from repository, type "python hang.py" in your terminal, and enjoy this beautiful game.
However, my dictionary has only three words, so live with that.

Have peace and prosper!
